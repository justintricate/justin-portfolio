        Hello! My name is Justin, and I enjoy creating websites and apps. When I
        was 10 years old, my dad told me I could pick out one book at our local
        bookstore. My selection was a C++ tutorial book. While I did not end
        becoming a 10-year old C++ prodigy, this would be the start of my
        interest in software engineering. This led into making custom Warcraft 3
        maps, making sure my Tumblr and MySpace were stylish, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to now, I have recently undergone a career change, and
        completed FullStack Academy's 17-week Full-Time Software Engineering
        Immersive course. I am excited to bring my newfound skills, along with
        my varied background in the armed forces and FinTech, to your team.
