      </h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Justin, and I enjoy creating websites and apps. When I
        was 9 years old, my dad took me to our local Half Price Books, and told
        me I could pick out one book of my choosing. My selection was a C++
        tutorial book. (This is a true story!) While I did not end becoming a
        9-year old C++ prodigy, this would be the start of my interest in
        software engineering. Eventually, this led into creating custom Warcraft
        3 maps, styling my MySpace/Tumblr, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to now, I have recently undergone a career change, and
        completed FullStack Academy's 17-week Full-Time Software Engineering
        Immersive course. While I have had the privilege of working on FinTech
        for nearly a decade, as well as 6 years serving in the U.S. Army, I am
        ready to bring my newfound skill set to your team.
      </p>
