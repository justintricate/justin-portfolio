## To Get Started:

<strong>1. Install:</strong> Install necessary dependencies. This project is built using SolidJS + Vite. Although mostly pure CSS, the "experience" swiper is a third-party library (swiper.js).
```sh
npm i
```

<strong>2. Watch:</strong>
This project uses <a href='https://gulpjs.com/'>Gulp</a> to minify the CSS for performance. It does this by watching over your styles.css, and creating a min.css file with no whitespace, which is the file that is ultimately deployed. Without this command, your styles.css will not update your dev environment.
```sh
npm run watch
```

<strong>3. Dev(elop):</strong> By default, Vite will use localhost:5173. It uses <a href='https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement'>'Hot Module Replacement'</a> which is just a fancy way of saying, you don't need to reload your dev environment as you make changes.
```sh
npm run dev
```
